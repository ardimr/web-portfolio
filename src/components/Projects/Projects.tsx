            The Train Booking System is a simple yet powerful application for managing train reservations and bookings. 
            This application provides an easy and convenient way for users to search for available trains, book tickets, and manage their travel plans.
            This application is inspired by KAI's booking system (Indonesian Railways Company).

            PPE is equipment that will protect the user against the risk of accidents or of adverse effects on health. 
            It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear, safety harnesses and respiratory protective equipment (RPE).
          </p>
          <p>
            This application can automatically detect whether a worker is wearing the necessary PPE for a specific task or environment.

          <p>
            Dagozilla Soccer Robot is a mobile robot that can play soccer autonomously. The robot has holonomic movement and using sensors to get the environment (field) information. This robot relies on omnidirectional camera as the main sensor, supported by the other sensors such as rotary encoder and compass to recognize itâ€™s position, orientation, velocity, and ball position. The robot also has dribbling and shooting shooting mechanism like a real footballer to create goals. In a national match, there are up to three robots can play together in a team using strategy.

          <p>
            The main idea of defect detection is comparing the inspected PCB and the template PCB to determine if there are any errors in the PCB being inspected. 
            The detection method utilizes binarization image processing modules, morphological operations, and image mathematical operations. 
            In the next stage, the detected defects can be classified using a machine learning model that is trained using a PCB defect type dataset.
